            <p>For every programmer curiosity and the urge of being good at something is always the motivation. If you
                know why you want to learn web development, go challenge yourself, that is motivation enough. For me it
                was the desire to make and build my own website</p>

                There are some things in life that are out of your control that you can't change and you've got
                to live
                with. The choice that we have, though, is either to give up or keep on going. I tell your life
                is
                interesting, Life is a JOURNEY and it is LIMITLESS.

            <p>
                Online and in-person forums have risen to solve problems, create learning opportunities, and encourage
                networking. Stack Overflow, blogs and open-source resources have become a place for developers to meet,
                improve, and share code without being in the same office. So always be connected with your community.
